Eye Exercise

Project description:
This project is two eyes following the curser around the screen. I was given source code of one eye, 
and my assignment was to add the second eye that also would follow the curser. I chose to also change
the background color from blue to purple. 

How to run:
this project is meant to run on a web browser. To run this project yourself, save all of its files in 
a single location on your machine. Next drag and drop the "index.html" file onto your web browser, 
Google Chrome recommended. Now the program is operational and you can click the button to run the 
route.

Roadmap for improvements:
I would love to add more style to this page, I think adding a little mouth below the eyes could look 
cute.
